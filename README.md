# High level synthesis used to generate pipelined fixed pointed divider
## Vitis HLS
- First implementation
- Passing testbench maybe needs better implementation with edge cases
- Could also be having issues with getting directly working with RTL

## Vivado HLS
- Incomplete
- Requires modifications to make sure that it can be used with Vivado HLS
- Possibly better for direct usage with RTL code unlike Vitis HLS

## Current Tasks
- Implement more test cases for the testbench of both versions
- Make the changes for Vivado HLS to work
