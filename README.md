# High level synthesis used to generate pipelined fixed pointed divider
## Vitis HLS
- Need to complete testbench, with more tests
- Fix ready valid interface
- need to be able to handle too larger or smaller numbers but hopefully Vitis actually does this under the hood

## Vivado HLS
- Will be removed as from what I checked the pragma being used are essentially the same as what is being used in Vitis HLS
